Presented at the Student Research Conference held by Truman State University in the Spring of 2021.  This project consists of utilizing current, on-the-market technologies, such as Amazonâ€™s Alexa A.I., with a personally developed Android-based application to control the actuation of a door, or a door lock, either through motion or via remote access. This project utilizes current, accessible technologies to stress the importance of understanding and exercising the use of current innovations to simplify a task on hand. Additionally, it demonstrates my ability to design and implement, through Java, a robust application that will allow a user to control the door to their home, office, or place of work without ever leaving their seat.
